      <h3>Polish Local Songs</h3>
      <p>by Jagoda Bracha</p>
      <p className="justify">
        During the Evening Activity, you will learn how to sing a couple of traditional, genuine, not well-known songs from Poland, mainly from the Lubelszczyzna region. In the past everyone met to make music together, so don’t hesitate to come even, if you think you’re bad at singing. It may be also an interesting linguistic challenge.

      <h3>Meditation</h3>
      <p>by Valeria Popescu</p>
      <p className="justify">Meditation is about training in awareness and getting a healthy sense of perspective. You’re not trying to turn off your thoughts or feelings. You’re learning to observe them without judgment. And eventually, you may start to better understand them as well. Learning to meditate is like learning any other skill. Think of it like exercising a muscle that you’ve never really worked out before. It takes consistent practice to get comfortable. And it’s usually easier if you have a teacher. We’ve got you covered there.</p>

    <h3>3 words game</h3>
    <p>by Miroslav Macko</p>
    <p className="justify">A team of 2-6 people creates a language by which they can tell each other how to perform any tasks. However, they can use just three words they choose to, let's say Cancer, Alabama, and Panda. Using those words they can signalize any possible movements (F.e. Cancer can mean move forward, Cancer Panda can mean jump, etc.). Then they pick one robot for an activity. The rest of the team gets to know the task and using those words has to make the robot accomplish the task. There are several rounds of different funny activities and in each round, the fastest team wins.</p>

      <h3>Yoga</h3>
      <p>by Valeria Popescu</p>
      <p className="justify">
        Yoga is the best way to start or end your day. It relaxes the whole body and calms the mind. The benefits it brings to the body are incredible. It is very important to have a good standing position and keep our spine straight and there are lots of yoga poses that help us do it. There are lots of us that spend a lot of time in front of a computer and forget about our body. It is important to care about it and I’m going to show you some interesting poses that you can always practice on your own.

      <h3>Secret Hitler</h3>
      <p>by Mykhailo Bondarenko</p>
      <p className="justify">
        Secret Hitler is a social deduction game for 5-10 people finding and stopping the Secret Hitler.
        Players are secretly divided into two teams: the liberals, who have a majority, and the fascists, who are hidden to everybody but each other. If the liberals can learn to trust each other, they have enough votes to control the elections and save the day. The fascists will say whatever to get elected, advance their agenda, and win the game.
        If you are a fan of Mafia or like killing Hitler followers (but don't miss in Liberals!!!) this game is for you.
